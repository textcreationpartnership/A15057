            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Your Honour was then giuen to vnderſtand, that they were anſwered by diuers, eſpecially by that worthie and excellent Inſtrument of Gods glorie, and one of the moſt glorious lights of our Engliſh Church, Doctor <hi>Whitakers.</hi> The book was ſhewed you; but being written in the Latin tongue, you wiſhed for the m re benefit of the generall, that it might be turned into Engliſh. Your will was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund vnto me, who profeſſe I owe much dutie to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and haue had leſſe opportunitie than will to ſhew it, for theſe few yeeres ſpace I haue been towards you: and now as ſoone as I could, for my publike ſeruice of the Church in my poore miniſterie, I haue effected it. Touching which if I may bee bold to deliuer what I thinke in few words, thus much I ſay for <hi>Campians</hi> reaſons: I account him bold in all, fooliſh in many things; yet wiſe in this, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning he tels vs they are his tenne chiefe Reaſons.

<pb facs="tcp:20548:4"/>little ſharpe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> the meekeſt man was once or twice moued at his people and their peruerſenes. For the matter, he hath kept that courſe with him, which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and commendably (in my poore opinion) obſerued, when he dealt with other aduerſaries, that is, hath anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the full that is obiected, but hath not troubled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to forecaſt what might be moreouer obiected, to take that away; which makes any mans worke both tedious and obſcure. And this as it ſeemeth hath been the cauſe of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus</hi> his replie: it falling out in this warre, which <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> ſpeakes of, as in marſhall affaires; when the defendant maketh ſhew of no more ſtrength, then that by which hee might wel repell and conquer the preſent aſſaults of the firſt part of the band; the ſecond is prouoked and tolled on vpon hope of the victorie, as if there were not ſtrength enough to reſiſt them: ſo <hi>Duraeus</hi> happily thought, that D. <hi>Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> had ſpent all his ſtrength in oppoſing of <hi>Campian,</hi> and that he ſhould haue found an eaſie aduerſarie in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond encounter: but his hopes deceiued him, for he hath found him ſufficient for this aſſault alſo. Now <hi>Duraeus</hi> his defence of <hi>Campian,</hi> and D. <hi>Whitakers</hi> of himſelf, haue I, according to your Honours deſire, annexed to the other, but yet only by briefe marginall notes: wherein I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to make both the obiection and anſwere as full as I could, and doe iniurie vnto neither. If the aduerſaries ſhall thinke that I haue not giuen their Champions reaſons and obiections, their full weight, I proteſt to them wittingly I haue not diminiſhed him any thing at all. If they thinke he hath any more force in himſelfe, let them tranſlate him into Engliſh; and though my leiſure be ſmall from my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Miniſtery and ordinarie ſtudies, yet will I take ſo much time fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, as to tranſlate Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> alſo to

In this which I haue done, I haue not taken that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie in tranſlating of the anſweres, as I finde he hath done who hath tranſlated <hi>Campian,</hi> and yet haue I not ſtrickt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tied my ſelfe vnto the words, but followed our Engliſh phraſe, which hath his proprietie of ſpeech, as well as the Latin. Not to be too troubleſome to your Honour in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding you from the treatiſe which followeth. When you come to it, you ſhall hardly finde any controuerſie betwixt vs and the Synagogue of Rome, but it is in part touched, (confuſedly I grant, but otherwiſe it could not be, ſeeing he was to follow the ſteps of him who had very little method in him, and leſſe matter) and therefore it may be as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiridion, which being euer had with you, and read with ſome diligence, as your great affaires of the ſtate will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you, you ſhall hardly be vnfurniſhed of ſome pregaant matter, againſt almoſt all the points, which the aduerſaries haue made goodly in ſhew, but nothing in ſubſtance.

In the latter part, becauſe he ſpeaketh of Authors not in our naturall tongue, in ſtead of them I would commend theſe vnto you, written originally in our owne tongue. For matter of controuerſie, Doctor <hi>Bilſon,</hi> now Lord Biſhop of Wincheſter, his true defence betweene Chriſtian ſubiection and vnchriſtian rebellion againſt the Ieſuites. Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> his anſwere to the Rhemiſt Teſtament, and diuers other of his workes: and Doctor <hi>Willets Synopſis.</hi> For matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the Workes of Maſter <hi>Greenham</hi> and Maſter <hi>Rogers.</hi> For matter both of conſcience and ſoundnes of faith, the Workes of Maſter <hi>Perkins.</hi> Many other particular Treatiſes of ſpeciall things there are, written by good and learned men; which you may reade as occaſion may offer it, and the aduice of diſcreete men may encourage you. Now with the bookes of the firſt kinde would I commend this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular book, which, at the commanding requeſt of an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſon, I haue both reduced into one booke, written
<pb facs="tcp:20548:8"/>by ſeuerall Authors in ſeuerall Treatiſes, and tranſlated into Engliſh for your benefit. In which the greateſt part of the controuerſies betwixt vs and the Church of Rome, you ſhall finde in ſome part touched. The ſtate of the queſtion plainly laid downe, and ſome manifeſt, ſhort and pithie anſwere or reſolution of it. Two Papiſts are the opponents, <hi>Campian</hi> an Engliſhman, and <hi>Duraeus</hi> a Scot; one Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a famous light of our Church hath anſwered them both. The anſwere to the firſt was more ſparing, becauſe the aduerſaries obiections were either ſlender, or ſleightly vrged. But there is ſo full a ſupplie made thereof by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the ſecond, that he had little ſtomacke or abilitie to make a reioynder.</p>
            <p>The whole worke I aſſure you (if you dare take my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) will be very profitable, if ſo be you will be attentiue &amp; diligent readers. For beſides that good which is in it ſelf, it will be a notable introduction to all other Treatiſes of controuerſies, that with more eaſe and facilitie you may reade them, and with more profit be conuerſant in them. The text (as I may ſo call it) is <hi>Campians</hi> and Doctor <hi>Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi> the marginall notes are compoſed of <hi>Duraeus</hi> his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections in defence of <hi>Campian</hi> and the Romiſh errors, and the replie of Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> in defence of the truth and his owne anſwere. <hi>Duraeus</hi> is noted thus; DVR. Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> thus; WHIT. I haue as fitly as I could placed euery obiection with his anſwere neere vnto that which is excepted againſt: and if any thing happen, by the ouerſight of the Printer, or length of the note to bee not ſo aptly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, take a little paines to looke ouer the precedent and ſubſequent pages.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe I haue in <hi>Duraeus</hi> omitted many things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they either were not pertinent for the defence of <hi>Campian,</hi> or but the multiplication of many teſtimonies out of the Fathers, which haue their full anſwere in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, or anſwered in ſome other place before.</p>
            <p>The number in euery anſwere noteth the page where it is to be found in Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> his replie, that any man
<pb facs="tcp:20548:9"/>may turne and reade the anſwere at large, if he vnderſtand the tongue, and receiue more contentment. Yet this know, there are ſeueral impreſſions of the bookes, which alſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; that which I followed was imprinted <hi>anno</hi> 1583.</p>
            <p>For the moſt part I haue onely in quotations ſet downe the booke, chapter and verſe, both of the Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſeldome recited the whole words (becauſe the margent would not beare it) but when the ſubſtance of the anſwere conſiſted in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and therfore you muſt both helpe me &amp; your ſelues in vſing your Bibles to peruſe the places.</p>
            <p>The ſuperiours directing you to what place euery note belongs, are the letters of the Alphabet. If there be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a note and no ſuperiour, you muſt conceiue it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs vnto the former note, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuperiour is. And if the number be ſomtimes omitted, you muſt ſo vnderſtand that the anſwere is in the ſecond page where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former is noted.</p>
            <p>The obiection you ſhall often finde to haue diuers parts and particulars in it, and ſo alſo the anſwere ſemblably. Therefore you muſt take paines for your profit to compare one thing with another, and one part with another.</p>
            <p>If you follow theſe directions, you ſhall reade the whole with no ſmall fruit to your ſelues. And yet to make it more profitable vnto you, I haue in reading the ſheetes ouer, as they were printed, gathered the ſumme of euery anſwere and the chiefe matter in it, not in any order, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, which had bin a thing impoſſible, becauſe no method is in it; not from any error of the Anſwerer, but becauſe he was forced to follow a fellow that rode a wilde gooſe chaſe. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of which epitomie may be this: If you reade the ſumme of euery anſwere, before you reade each particular anſwer, it will well prepare you to conceiue of the anſwere it ſelfe; if after, which I could wiſh alſo you would doe, then it will preſent to you the whole as it were in a mappe. When you haue read both and the whole booke, if at any time you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſome thing you would ſee more particularly, and can but tell or make ſome nie coniecture in what anſwere it is laid downe, with reading of one page you may finde in

            <head>TO THE MOST LEARNED VNIVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SITIE MEN, FLORISHING BOTH AT OXFORD AND <hi>Cambridge, Edmond Campian</hi> ſendeth greeting.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I returned (most worthy men) into this Iland, a yeere agoe, vpon commandement of my ſuperiours, according to the order of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which I profeſſe; I found ſtormes farre more dangerous on the Engliſh coasts, than thoſe were which I had lately eſcaped on the Brittaine Ocean. But when I had gone further into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I ſawe nothing more vſuall, then vnuſuall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nothing more certaine than vncertaine daungers. Then I plucks vp my heart, as well as I could, calling to mind the goodnes of my cauſe, and not forgetting the troubles of theſe times. And least peraduenture I ſhould be caught before that any man heard what I had to ſay; forthwith I writ downe my determination, why I came, what I ſought for, what manner of warre, and against whom I purpoſed to proclaime it. The firſt draught of my
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20548:22"/>writing, I kept ſtill about me, that if I were apprehended it might be found with me. A copie thereof I left in keeping with a friend of mine, which vnawares trulie to me, was ſhewed to many other men, and by them coppied out. The Aduerſaries tooke the ſchedule, being publiſhed, in ill part, most ſpitefully reprehending both all the rest, as alſo this, that I alone in this matter of Religion, had made the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to all. Although in very deed, I alone would not haue entred the list; if with licence of her Maiestie, and ſafe conduct theſe diſputations had been granted: <hi>Hanmer</hi> and <hi>Charke,</hi> haue made anſwere to my challenge: what I pray you? though it were long before? To no purpoſe at all, for they ſhall giue no anſwere honestly but one, which I feare they will neuer giue, to wit: <hi>We accept of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, The Queenes Maieſtie hath giuen her word, that you ſhall come and goe ſafe: make haſte hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde.</hi> In the meane while they are full of their exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Fie vpon thy ſocietie, out vpon thy ſeditions, art thou not aſhamed of thine arrogancie, thou art a Traitor, doubtles thou art a Traitor: fooliſhly ſaid of them: Why do thoſe men, not the vnaduiſedst of all the rest, ſo lauiſhlie looſe their labour and cost of pen inke and paper? But there is of late a little booke very plaine, ſet forth for theſe two men to peruſe (the former of which for his pleaſure and recreation took my ſaid paper in hand, to confute the ſame: the other more maliciouſly hudleth vp the whole matter) which ſo farre forth as was expedient, entreates both of our ſociety, and of theſe mens iniuries, and of the charge which I haue vndertaken. There remaineth only for me (for as I perceiue, our Biſhops prouide ſcourges, and not Schooles) that I might render an account of my ſaid fact, euidently to ſhew, and as it were with my finger to point out vnto you
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20548:22"/>the chiefe Chapters and fountaines of the things, that breed in me ſuch confidence. And withall to exhort you, who eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially aboue all others haue to do herein, that you will looke vnto this charge, with ſuch carefull diligence, as <hi>Chriſt, the Church, the Common-wealth,</hi> and the ſaluation of your owne ſoules do require at your hands. If I vpon the affiance of my wit, learning, art, reading, or memorie, haue thus challenged the best learned of the Aduerſaries, I was in ſo doing most vain-glorious, and proud aboue meaſure, for that I conſidered neither them, nor my ſelf more deeply. But if vpon conſiderations of the cauſe, I thought my ſelfe able enough to proue that this ſunne ſhineth now at <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> you must beare with this my feruent zeale, which the honor of Ieſus Christ my King, and inuincible truth, haue vrged me vnto.</p>
            <p>Yee know that <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> in his oration for <hi>Quintius,</hi> when <hi>Roſcius</hi> warranted him that he ſhould get the better, if he could proue that it was not poſsible for a man to trauaile <hi>700.</hi> miles within two daies ſpace, was not only nothing afraid of the force and ſtrength of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Orator <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> but alſo cared nothing for <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus, Cotta, Antonius,</hi> or <hi>Craſſus,</hi> who were Orators farre more excellent then <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was. And were (as he iudged) the principall Orators of his time. There is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a truth in all matters, ſo apparent and euident, that neither any iugling trickes, or enchaunting words can darken the beames thereof. But that which I intend to proue is much more plaine, then was that ſuppoſition of <hi>Roſcius:</hi> for if I ſhall proue this, that there is a heauen, a God, a faith, a Christ, I haue gotten the victorie. Should I not in this cauſe then be couragious? Truly wel may I be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but ouercome I cannot be: for I depend vpon thoſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20548:23"/>Doctors, whom that holy ſpirit hath inſtructed, which can neither be deceiued nor ouercome. I beſeech you, haue a care of your ſoules health: of whom I ſhall obtaine this, I expect the reſt aſſuredly. Let this be your only care and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation: Firſt to giue your ſelues to earneſt prayer, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlie to ſtudie alſo: and yee ſhall find out the very depth of the matter, and that the Aduerſaries are in deſpaire; and that we being ſo ſurely grounded, haue good cauſe, chearefully and couragiouſly, to looke and long after theſe diſputations. I am the ſhorter in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, becauſe that all the Treatiſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appertaineth properly to you.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWERE TO CAMPIANS E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PISTLE WRITTEN TO THE STVDENTS OF THE <hi>two famous Vniuerſities, Oxford and Cambridge.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Yeere agoe, you write, it fell out, <hi>That according to the order of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which you profeſſe, vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of your Superiours, you returned into this Iland.</hi> Whether, <hi>Campian,</hi> you came willingly and of your owne accord; or of a certaine neceſſitie by the order of your profeſſion and Ieſuiticall ſect, you were compelled to returne into England (whence ſome yeeres ago you departed) I will not be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue of, becauſe it is not much for the purpoſe we haue in hand: It had bin far more glorious for you, and more befitting the perſon you made ſhew to be, not to haue crept in obſcurely and by ſtealth, but to haue returned with credit and authoritie. But who is he that had power to ſend you an Embaſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a forreine country, or what neceſſity lay vpon you to obey his commaundement, who had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to enioyne you a iourney, whither you were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20548:24"/>vnwilling to goe? If that Spaniſh Souldier, the firſt Author of your Ieſuiticall ſocietie, were now aliue and ſhould enioyne you to ſet your country on fire; would you obey him? I am ſure you would ſay, he would neuer commaund ſo foule a fact. And yet he might better commaund and you execute that, then this thing for which you profeſſe you are now come hither. For whether, I pray you, may we deeme leſſe, to ſet houſes on fire, then to diuert the minds of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from true Religion, to trouble the peace of a Common-wealth, to eſtrange the minds of loyall Subiects from their lawfull Prince, and to turne all things topſie turuie; which yet was the end of your comming, and the order of your profeſſion required no leſſe at your hands? But let vs heare how you go about your Embaſſage: <hi>when,</hi> ſay you, <hi>I had gone fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into England I ſaw nothing more vſuall then vnuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all puniſhments.</hi> But <hi>Campian,</hi> what be they? Do you eft-ſoones ſo ſlaunder the mild gouernment of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> &amp; accuſe it of cruelty, (England neuer enioying a more mercifull Prince) that you affirme you find nothing ſo common as vnuſuall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? But what new kind of torture haue you ſeene in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſince you came into it? Or which of your men can you name who hath bin condemned &amp; put to death for Religion, not only ſince you came into England, but for theſe 23. yeeres, the whole time that good <hi>Elizabeth</hi> hath ſwayed the Scepter of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? It is true indeed that ſome few haue bin pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed who iumpe with you in opinion and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but they died not for religion, but were by open iudgment of law conuicted of Treaſon. There was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20548:24"/>of late executed one <hi>Euerard</hi> a Prieſt, ſent from the Colledge at Rhemes into England. Who though he was in daunger to the Lawes many waies, yet might haue had his life, but that impudently at the barre he vttered things ſhamefull, vile, and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; For he boaſted himſelfe both to be the ſubiect and Vaſſall of the Pope, euen in England, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the Pope was no leſſe the head of the Church of England, then of the Church of Rome. Auouching further that he was verily perſwaded, that the Pope did not erre when he termed Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> an Heretike, and the Patron of Heretikes, and denounced her no lawfull Queene. <hi>Euerard</hi> was for this confeſſion conuicted and condemned, who afterwards (as if this had not been enough) in priſon profeſſed plainly and directly in the preſence and hearing of Sixteene men of credit; That it was no ſinne againſt God to commit treaſon againſt his Prince. Yet for all this he ſuffered no new and vnuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all puniſhment, but the ſame that all Traytors ſuffer among vs in the like caſe. But who are you and what is your religion, that you ſo bouldly obiect crueltie vnto vs? Heare me this one thing, <hi>Campian,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it if you can. It is not long ſince moe of our brethren were condemned by you at one Seſſion, executed in one day, conſumed in one fire, then you can recount to me haue yet bin put to death for the Popes cauſe at any time, or by any kind of death, in the whole happie raigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Doe but call to mind, <hi>Campian,</hi> the rare cruelty, the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite tortures, the frequent Martyrdome of former times: and if there be in you any ſparke of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20548:25"/>you cannot chuſe but confeſſe that your ſide hath been extreme cruell, and we ſufficiently prouoked to ſeueritie againſt you, and to haue repayed you with the like. For what times I pray you can afford vs ſuch and ſo many butcheries of men, as was to be ſeene when you were Lords ouer vs, and which are yet freſh in memorie? Tell vs what ſexe or age you ſpared, and did not bloodilie execute all without difference and diſtinction of learned or vnlearned, male or female, old or young, Children, Virgins, Married, Clergie and Laytie, Biſhops, Archbiſhops eſcaped not your hands? The Martyrs you did beate with roddes, their tongues you pulled out of their mouthes, their hands you burned off with Torches, you tormented, crucified, hanged and beheaded them, you burnt them aliue, and toſted them at a ſoft fire, yea the Infant leaping out of the mothers bellie you receiued vpon the ſpeares point and caſt it into the flaming fire. To conclude, whatſoeuer barbarous crueltie could inuent, that you were not wanting to put in execution againſt them. And if your crueltie had ended with the liuing, and had terminated in their deathes, it had been leſſe; but ſo raging was your tyranny, that you tooke vp the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Saints interred in the earth, you arreigned them vpon a day, accuſed them at a barre, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to death, and burned them at a ſtake; euen exceeding thoſe old tyrants in furie, and crueltie. Can you name any one ſuch ſauage fact amongſt vs? or what was he that was put to death amongſt vs, whom euery good man that heard of him iudged not worthie of death threefold more then life?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20548:25"/>Wherefore <hi>Campian</hi> acknowledge your owne cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, and accuſe not ours, which if it were as great as you would make men beleeue, yea if any at all, you would not haue ſo eaſilie and ſpeedily obeyed your Principall, commaunding your returne hither. But proceed to tel vs after your comming what you did: <hi>least peraduenture</hi> (ſay you) <hi>I ſhould haue been caught before that any man heard what I had to ſay, forthwith I writ downe my determination and purpoſe why I came, what I ſought for, what manner of warre, and against whom I purpoſed to proclaime it.</hi> The end then of your comming was to proclaime warre againſt vs. But neither he that ſent you was an enemy for any iuſt cauſe on our parts, neither haue you duly performed an Heralds office: for you no ſooner ſet your foote vpon Engliſh ground, but you hidde your ſelfe in corners, that we could enioy no ſight of you. If this be to diſcharge your commiſſion, iudge you. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, this ſo tymorous and fooliſh proclaiming of warre, made little for your honeſtie, or the honor of your holy Father that ſent you. <hi>The first draught of writing</hi> (ſay you) <hi>I kept ſtill about me, that if I were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, it might be found with me. A copy thereof I left in keeping with a friend of mine, which vnawares truly to me was ſhewed vnto many other men, and by them copied out.</hi> How true this Narration of yours is, let others conceiue as they liſt, for my part I giue no credit at all to it. For if you came, as you ſay, to proclaime warre againſt vs, ſhall we thinke thoſe letters of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance were publiſhed without and againſt your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie? Beſides your letters of challenge which your fauorites ſpread abroad, were ſo cleerelie written, that they foretold not of an enemie comming on,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20548:26"/>but pointed at him as alreadie come, and readie to pray vpon vs; ſo that after I ſaw your glorious and maruellous challenge, I made full account to ſee you ſhortly after in the middeſt of our Vniuerſities, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Oxford or Cambridge. But why did you ſet downe your determination in writing, except your purpoſe were to publiſh it? you ſay: <hi>that it might be found with you, if you were taken.</hi> What is that we heare from you, <hi>Campian?</hi> came you to lurke in holes, and to betake your ſelfe to your hecles, or came you to diſpute? I find no truth in your words, nor liklihood of truth in this tale; I would I could find you had either <hi>iudgement or memorie. Hanmer and Charke,</hi> ſaie you, <hi>haue anſwered my challenge:</hi> verily theſe two wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie men, now named, haue ſo intertained your moſt vaine and more then intolerable bragging ſchedule and Libell, as it well deſerued, and haue paſſing well abated your Ieſuiticall and childiſh triumph. But why I pray you, haue you ſlipped ouer that anſwere of learned M. <hi>Charke,</hi> and made no reply to it? you refute all they bring againſt you in one word, ſaying. <hi>All that they alledge is to no purpoſe at all.</hi> An anſwere ſoone made, and not vnſutable to <hi>Campians</hi> carriage. but tell vs why? for ſay you, they can make no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the purpoſe, but this: <hi>we accept your offers, her Maiestie hath promiſed ſafe conduct; come let vs conferre;</hi> how childiſh is it to expect ſuch an anſwere; which if they ſhould promiſe, it is not in their power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. Though <hi>Campian,</hi> perſwade your ſelfe, if this liberty were graunted vs, it ſhould be as acceptable to vs in deed, as it is to you in ſhew. If her excellent Maieſtie and her wiſe Counſell did thinke it fit, and for common peace that publike diſputation ſhould
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20548:26"/>be held about Religion, are you ſo ſillie to thinke you ſhould haue none to encounter with you, or you ſhould carrie the day without blow or bloodſhed? I am not comparable to <hi>Charke, Hanmer,</hi> nor infinit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who are either profeſſors in the Vniuerſitie, or haue a charge in the Church, yet I ſhould not thinke my ſelfe fit to liue, if I feared to buckle in any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie with you: for if you be the man, <hi>Campian,</hi> whom we heere ſome weekes paſt in a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, diſcourſing what you could, and diſputing your beſt, I ſee not any cauſe, why any one of vs ſhould feare to ioyne with ſuch an Aduerſarie in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny controuerſie. For how did you acquite your ſelf that day? you were dealt withal by our men in ſome parts of your pamphlet, wherin it is likely you could eaſilie giue euery man ſatisfaction and leaſt you ſhould complaine you were iniured, if any new thing had been propounded to you. And wheras in the entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce you bitterly inueighed againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> &amp; writ that in ſome deſperate mood he called the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Iames</hi> a ſwelling, barren, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentious, &amp; ſtrawen Epiſtle. The booke was brought you, where you feigned ſuch things were written, and you were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſhew the place; when you ſaw you were taken tardy, you would faine haue put off the imputation of a ſlaunderer, and inuented a ſhift, worth all mens obſeruation; for, ſay you, the preface where it was, is purged of it, and yet it is very manifeſt, that there was neuer one word changed in it. At laſt you made this anſwere, which made all men laugh exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and indeed it was very rediculous; that you would ſend to the Emperour and to the Duke of Bauaria, who ſhould certifie her Maieſtie, that <hi>Luther</hi> had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20548:27"/>written ſuch things. But yet in another booke of his, you think you haue gotten ſome matter of triumph. For <hi>Luther</hi> in his booke written of the captiuitie of Babylon, hath this ſaying, that many with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie auouch, <hi>This Epistle to be none of S. Iames, nor to be anſwerable to the ſpirit of an Apostle:</hi> heere you cry out, oh horrible blaſphemie? Anſwere was made you, that <hi>Luther</hi> did not ſay it himſelfe, but brought others in, probablie affirming it. Doe you ſuppoſe there is no difference betwixt theſe two? yet you ſtill vrged the point, and clamorouſly obiected blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie: <hi>Euſebius</hi> was ſhewed you, who in plaine words calleth this Epiſtle corrupt, and counterfeit; and with this you were put to ſilence, and had not to anſwere: only that you might probablie in ſhew conuince <hi>Luther</hi> of blaſphemie, you demaunded of our men their iudgment of this Epiſtle. They cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered that they accounted this Epiſtle of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> as all other the Epiſtles and bookes of the new Teſtament, to be Canonicall. Affirming that all our Churches were of the ſame iudgement. And from this you would conclude, that <hi>Luther</hi> therefore was blaſphemous, becauſe he had written that ſome probablie called the authoritie of this Epiſtle into queſtion. To this our men replied, the conſequence was naught, from our reuerent opinion of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, to inferre, that whoſoeuer made any queſtion of it, did blaſpheme. And heere you plainely yeelded; For when you boaſted of two other reaſons that you had, you produced none at all. After this you came to the old Teſtament, where you accuſe vs to haue raced many bookes out of the true Canon. The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of Antiquitie was laid before you, whence
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20548:27"/>it was cleere that thoſe bookes were not Canonicall. Heere you preferred the late Councels and Fathers before the auncient, which may not be permitted you. And you ſet <hi>Austine</hi> in oppoſition againſt <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> when it had been fitter you would haue recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled them. <hi>Augustine,</hi> he affirmes theſe bookes to be Canonicall, <hi>Hierome</hi> denies them, yea expreſly, plainly, and euidently. For <hi>Augustine</hi> our men an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he vſed the word Canonicall doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in diuers ſignification. And that they ſhewed plainely out of <hi>Augustines</hi> owne words, and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Caietans. Augustine</hi> you ſhifted off, and <hi>Caietan</hi> you audaciouſly reproached, affirming that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall loſt all his grace and elegancie, when he once began to Comment vpon the Scriptures. At length, <hi>Campian,</hi> you were forced euen in <hi>Gratian,</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bluſhing, to acknowledge this ambiguity of the word. And whereas you could not be ignorant of auncient records, it was a wonder to our men to ſee you write, that we had of a ſudden raced out theſe bookes. Surely this word eſcaped you very vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly and inconſideratly; we haue ſtore both of auncient witneſſes, and of others ſucceeding them, who will and can free vs from ſuch imputation of Noueltie. To paſſe by <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Euſebius, Cyprian,</hi> or whoſoeuer he was that writ the expoſition of the Creed, we find among his workes after he had rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned vp all the Canonicall bookes of the old and new Teſtament, he addeth: <hi>Theſe are thoſe bookes which the Fathers haue included in the Canon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cyprian. in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ. Symbo.</note> 
               <hi>where they would that all the grounds of our faith, ſhould haue their foundation. Yet we must know that there are other bookes which were not called of our predeceſſors Canonicall, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20548:28"/>Eccleſiasticall, as the booke of Wiſedome, ſaid to be Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and another booke of Wiſdome, ſaid to be Syrackes. Of the ſame rancke, is the little booke of Toby, and Iudith, and the bookes of the Machabies.</hi> To him I will adde an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, later in time, and yet he writ 400. yeeres agoe. <hi>Hugo de ſancto victore,</hi> a very learned man, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in his time.

Which being ſo, doth it become you <hi>Campian,</hi> to be ſo iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vnto vs, ſo boldly to affirme that we haue late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie croſſed out thoſe bookes out of the Canon? or which of vs wil be afraid of you triffling ſo childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? pleaſe not your ſelf too much with your wit, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abuſe the gifts and parts, which you haue gotten by nature or induſtry, to defend falſhood, and to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the kingdome of Antichriſt.

Now whereas you intreate vs to haue a care of our ſoules health, we take in good part your deſire and endeuour of our ſaluation. And indeed we our ſelues do giue all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence we can to attaine true ſauing health: to which ſeeing there is but one way, and that plainely laid downe in the Scriptures: we againe beſeech you, that renouncing all humane inuentions, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe innumerable fictions of Poperie, wherto for theſe few yeares paſt you haue bin addicted, you would alſo with vs labour for that eternall ſaluation, which the Scripture hath propounded to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and to as many as are deſirous of eternall life.

Of which neuertheleſſe, they could no ſooner ſhift their hands, then ſuppe vp hot coales or eate hard ſtones. Then this firſt reaſon ſeemed to me vrgent and iuſt, which when it had euidently laid before mine eyes, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries ſide was but counterfeited and feeble, truely it incouraged me much, being both a Chriſtian, and alſo ſomewhat beaten in this kind of ſtudie, in defence of the euerlaſting Kings Charter, to encounter with the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunts of theſe diſcomfited enemies.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20548:33"/>if you thinke our diſtruſtfulnes will helpe you any thing, you much deceiue your ſelfe, for if we haue with courage ſtood againſt your predeceſſors ſo far ſurpaſſing you, we will not yeeld a haire to you? nor feare your manner of conflict, being ſo childiſh in the iudgement of all men. But this diffidence, you ſo caſt in our diſh, tell vs what it is, and how it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares ſo clearely, Forſooth we diſtruſt our hold in the Scriptures, <hi>and the maiestie of Gods bookes we haue most filthilie corrupted.</hi> This indeed is a very great cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination you obiect to vs, and an vndoubted proofe of our diſtruſt: for they who are not able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Religion they profeſſe, vnleſſe they lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands vpon the Scriptures, and impeach the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred authoritie of thoſe heauenly bookes, the cauſe on their ſide muſt be very naught and deſperate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Therfore I graunt vnto you, that it was very fearefull deſperation, which made the Manachies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the old Teſtament wholy, and cancell part of the new: the ſame alſo made <hi>Ebion</hi> reiect all <hi>Paules</hi> Epiſtles, and other heretikes to do ſo too: for there was nothing fitter for them to vphold thoſe their monſtrous opinions, then by denying thoſe bookes of holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>But I pray you <hi>Campian,</hi> let vs ſee how theſe things make for your purpoſe: or what it is wherein we are ſo like thoſe forenamed Heretikes.

If we haue ſhaken hands with the Manachees, if with the Ebionits, tell vs wherein? But if we are culpable of no ſuch thing, the Lord ſhall iudge your outragious and bold ſlaunders, and maintaine our vprightnes and innocency. For who euer thought and ſpoke more honorably, reuerently and with more due regard of

But you obiect againſt <hi>Luther</hi> his Apoſtaſie: look to your ſelfe <hi>Campian,</hi> if you may not bee more iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed of this crime: for doubtleſſe you are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Apoſtata, or you were a cunning hypocrite. But if it be Apoſtaſie to forſake Apoſtataes, then was <hi>Luther</hi> ſuch an Apoſtata. For hee abandoned theeues, heretikes, Apoſtataes, and ſeparated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20548:46"/>preferreth the Goſpell of <hi>Iohn</hi> before the other three, becauſe he ſetteth downe the Acts of Chriſt more briefly, and his Sermons more fully.

As for the honorable praiſes of the Church, you mention, we both acknowledge thoſe, and ſpeake far greater things of it: but verily they agree not to your Church at all; for it is the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh whoore, a branch cut off from the true Vine, a denne of theeues, a broad way leading to deſtruction, the kingdome of hell, the body of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, a ſinke of errors, a great mother of fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Church of the wicked, out of which euery Chriſtian ought to depart, which Chriſt ſhal one day fearefully deſtroy, and giue her the iuſt recompence of all her ſinnes.

They had the Scripture, they were a people zealous of the law, they had the Temple, they had Leuits, Prieſts, yea a high Prieſt; what was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting here to make a perfect Church? Chriſt at length ſheweth himſelfe openly, and bringeth that happie meſſage of ſaluation; this very Church hated, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, curſed, and in the end killed this Chriſt, the Son of God, the lagat of his Father, the teacher of celeſtiall doctrine; the author of our ſaluation. This Church then, <hi>Campian,</hi> was it a true Church or no, what think you? If it was, then the true Church hated Chriſt, and iudged him worthy of death. If it was not, then where and what is the true Church? for

And for the Propheſies you recier, they belong to the company of the elect, and not to your popiſh Church to which the Lord neuer promiſed any ſuch thing.

And whereas he calleth Rome the head of all the Churches, his meaning was, that it was the firſt, greateſt, and moſt famous Church.</note> Chalcedon, that thereby you may proue that the

For this was not done by any commaundement of Chriſt, that the Church of Rome ſhould excell in dignitie, all other Churches of the world: but the Fathers te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, that the cauſe why that Citie was inueſted with greater priuiledge than others, was this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the chiefe ſeate of the Empire. You may finde the words themſelues in the ſame acte which you cite.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 16.</note> But if (as you ſay) the Church of Rome ought to haue the preheminence aboue all other Churches in the world, in diuine authoritie, what then ment the Chalcedonian Fathers, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that there were ſome prerogatiues graunted vnto that Church, for this cauſe alone; in that Rome was the head of the Empire, and therefore they thought that the Biſhop of that Citie, which was the Empreſſe of the world, was worthie of ſome more honour than others? And this honour to ſpeake of was onely this; that the Biſhop of Rome ſhould haue the preheminence of place in Councels, the prioritie of ſpeech in deliuering his opinion, and the precedence in rancke and place. And thus neither doe we our ſelues, now much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie this honour to the Romane Biſhop, but that if ſo it pleaſe him, he may enioy it; ſo that he doe not (becauſe he hath the chiefe place) imperiouſlie ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranize ouer his brethren, as he hath done for many ages, and perſwadeth himſelfe that he may doe it lawfully.

And what I pray you, did the Emperors authoritie, commandement, or publike warrantize profit him? <hi>The Emperor</hi> (ſay you) <hi>ſigned it, but the ſtate of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, greater than the Emperors, did repeale it.</hi> And who then can be ſafe, if the Emperors beare no ſway in the Councell? Neither doth the horrible murther of <hi>Iohn Huſſe,</hi> contrarie to a publike war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of protection, ſo much diſcourage vs from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to your Councels, as that decree publiſhed by the Councell it ſelfe, <hi>That promiſe is not to be kept with Heretikes.</hi> Should I then beleeue you, who I know will keepe no promiſe? If I doe, ſurely I am worthy to periſh after the ſame manner. <hi>Hierome</hi> of Prage likewiſe came to the Councell of his owne accord, and making publike profeſſion of his faith, was burned. So that the caſe of theſe two, (than the which all Chriſtendome at that time had not any more holy or learned) ſhall remaine as a perpetuall monument of your treacherie and moſt horrible crueltie; and as a notable caueat vnto all the godly, to beware of you for the time to come. Concerning <hi>Luther,</hi> whom you, curſed Frier, call the hatred of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20548:78"/>God and men, the hand and power of God himſelfe ſo defended him, that you could neuer hurt him. For will was not wanting to you for the deſtruction of <hi>Luther,</hi> but opportunitie. <hi>But he was ſafe</hi> (ſay you) <hi>vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Emperors word:</hi> neither in truth durſt the Pope attempt <hi>Luthers</hi> death, after the Emperor had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him ſafetie. For would <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, thinke you, haue endured it? It was not behoofefull for the Pope to haue attempted any thing, whereby the Emperors faith might appeare falſified: for <hi>Charles</hi> would neuer ſo eaſilie haue put vp ſuch an indignitie as <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> had done in time paſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſay you) <hi>they doe too much brag in corners, in which when they haue but ſounded three Greeke words, they would ſeeme to be very wiſe.</hi> They might perhaps ſeeme wiſe to you, who ſcarcely (as I ſuppoſe) can ſound three Greeke words. <hi>They cannot</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>indure the light, which would bring a Scholler into account, and would recall him into ſome place of recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi> and is this it, <hi>Campian,</hi> which you hunt after, a name, ſame, places of account, to be poynted at with the finger, and to be thus ſpoken of, <hi>This is the man aduanced to greatest grace, excelling in worth, and worthy place?</hi> Doth this grieue you that you are not highly eſteemed of, and doe not ſit in high place? Well man, proceede in your vertuous courſes, and goe forward in the way, into the which you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to your great praiſe, and there is good hope you may aſcend vnto ſuch an high place as you are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of.</p>
               <p>But wheras you deſire, <hi>That the Engliſh Catholikes may obtaine a Patent of impunity, if they loue the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſoules,</hi> ſurely you require a thing vniuſt &amp; vnequal. For what liknes is there in this, that learned men ſhould aſſemble from all parts, vnto a publike Councell, and that Runnagates ſhould be permitted to returne vnto their countrie? <hi>We will</hi> (ſay you) <hi>with
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20548:78"/>winged ſpeed haſt vnto the Court, relying our ſelues vpon the Princes word.</hi> And ſo indeed you ſafely may: for if ſhee giue her word, you may promiſe vnto your ſelues aſſured ſecuritie. And I the more eaſilie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue you ſpeake the truth, ſeeing ſome of you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, haue haſted into the Gourt, hauing no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from the Prince to reſt vpon. But <hi>Campian,</hi> flie you rather to the Indians, that you may take a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey of your Popes new Prouince: for our moſt wiſe Prince deſires no ſuch gueſts, but baniſheth you as farre as ſhe can from her.</p>
               <p>But now at length you returne thither whence you haue digreſſed, and gloriouſlie conclude this poynt, concerning Councels: ſaying, <hi>The generall Councels make all for me, the first, last, and middle.</hi> You haue gotten an eaſie and ſpeedie victorie: I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perſwaded that you are become another <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar: V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A whole day would not be enough for me to reckon all the Epistles, Sermons, Homilies, Orations, Treatiſes, and disputations of the old Fathers, wherein of ſet purpoſe both grauely and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, they haue confirmed our Catholike doctrine. So long as theſe bookes of theſe Fathers ſhall be ſold at the Stationers ſhop, in vaine are the hauens and ſea coasts watched ſo narrowly; to no purpoſe, are houſes, coffers, and chests ſtraightly ſearched; to no end, are penall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations ſet vpon ſo many gates. For none of our late writers, neither <hi>Harding,</hi> nor <hi>Sanders,</hi> nor <hi>Allen,</hi> nor <hi>Stapleton,</hi> nor <hi>Briſtol,</hi> do more vehemently inueigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe their new found dreames, then thoſe Fathers do, whom I haue named: which things when I well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,

The caſe was with the Church of Rome, as we ſee it is in a great building: for as a houſe which is ſtrongly built at the firſt, continueth ſo of it ſelfe a long time after ſound and whole; but if for a time it be left and neglected, it beginneth in ſome place to decay, and to bee full of chinkes, which in time waxe big by degrees, till they threaten ruine to the poſts and roofes themſelues, and at length by this meanes, the whole building is ruinated and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth downe: ſo the Romane Church in proceſſe of

But when the Scripture is manifeſt, that Chriſt did not take our nature whole and ſound, as it was then in <hi>Adam,</hi> but infirme and weake, yet without ſinne; it is no maruell if he would be borne ſuch as we are, not ſuch as <hi>Adam</hi> was created.</note>

If you can conclude that conſequent out of our iudgement, that Chriſt was ignorant of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, which hee then ought to haue knowne, when he was ignorant of it, then you put vs downe from this our ſtanding. For it is not a fault not to know thoſe things, which yet may bee knowne, vnleſſe it concerne vs to haue them knowne.

And you can neuer proue, that ignorance in Chriſt was any whit more faultie, than death. Chriſt as he was a true man, albeit a pure man, ſo hee did neuer thinke, imagine or vnderſtand all things at once, and he did ſleepe ſometimes. Do you thinke that Chriſt while hee was ſleeping, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all things in his memorie? which though you ſhould affirme, yet I ſee no reaſon to beleeue you.

Did Chriſt ſo much abhorre this death, which the Martyrs haue gone vnto, ioyfull and cheerefull? That were indeede to caſt a greater reproch vpon Chriſt, while ye would auoide the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer. Wherefore that which raiſed ſo great horrors in Chriſt, was the moſt bitter wrath of God againſt mankinde, which Chriſt muſt needes haue ſuffered for a time.

Hence came that ſpeech vpon the Croſſe, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> which he vttered not fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, but from his heart; not deſpairingly, as you wickedly write, but vpon the conſideration of Gods wrath, which then he was to be ſubiect vnto.<note n="m" place="margin">DVR. <hi>Christ truly was the Sonne of God, who knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe worthie of wrath, and ſo could not feare the paines of hell.</hi> WHIT. pag. 558.

For the Papiſts with their dull hearts cannot conceiue, what Chriſt performed for vs by his death, and what paines hee endured for the ſatisfying of his Father. Therefore they thinke wrong is done to Chriſt, when we ſay he ſuffered thoſe things which hee both would and ought to haue ſuffered for vs. For it was neceſſarie not onely that Chriſt ſhould die in<note n="n" place="margin">DVR. <hi>Christ being God and man ſatisfied the diuine iustice, not by the greatnes and multitude of his puniſhment, but by the weight of his actions, euerie one of vvhich is ſufficient to be a full price of mans redemption.

But Chriſts righteouſneſſe is not, not at all. For Chriſt performed all things vvhich the Lavv required, therefore vvas indued vvith the qualitie of perfect iuſtice: but that reaſon which perſwadeth vs, to confeſſe, that this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the Law in Chriſt was a quality, the ſame compelleth vs to thinke that this righteouſneſſe is not a quality inherent in vs; for that vvee neuer in our owne perſon obeyed the Lavv.

If you aske, how that is yours, vvhich is not inherent in you; I ſay againe, which thing the Apoſtle doth ſo oft preſſe, it is yours by imputation. Now rub vp your Philoſophie, if you can, to proue that nothing is made ours by imputation.</note> 
                  <hi>a Relation,</hi> yet Philoſophie will not be caſhierd: but that it is a quality you can neuer proue, either out of the Predicaments, or out of the chiefeſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie. But your Theologicall vertues, faith, hope, and charity, had neuer any iniurie offred to them by vs: indeed they be ſo handled by you, that you ſeeme to take them not for Theologicall, but for Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:20548:133"/>vertues. But the cauſe that maketh vs not to hold, that our righteouſnes is compounded of theſe vertues, as you would haue it, is this, becauſe they are neuer ſo perfect in this life, as throughlie to ſatisfie the law of God: now the law muſt be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or elſe we cannot be iuſt. For the Lord doth allow no other righteouſnes, but the very ſame which is deſcribed in the law, which whoſoeuer cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, are pronounced guilty of eternall death. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we will be righteous and ſaued, and free from that horrible curſe, ſuch a righteouſneſſe muſt bee ſought out, than which the law cannot require a more abſolute. And where ſhall we find this? Is it in our vertues, in our faith, in our charitie? But theſe are weake many waies, and want that integrity which the law requireth, &amp; wherunto it propoundeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes. For faith is but begun, &amp; we are alwaies to pray that it may bee increaſed in vs. Now if faith be weak,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom</hi> 1.17. <hi>Luc.</hi> 17.5.</note> other vertues which ſpring from faith, cannot be perfect. But righteouſneſſe muſt be of that kind, as that nothing at all may be added thereunto. From hence it followeth, that righteouſneſſe is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of our vertues, as you vnfitly ſpeake, but it muſt be fetcht elſewhere. Seeing therefore wee had no ſuch vertue, as might obtaine righteouſneſſe for vs with the Lord, Chriſt was giuen vs by the Lord, who performed perfect obedience to the law, that by his obedience we might be made righteous.

For true faith cannot agree with vnbeliefe. It is the propertie of this to diſtruſt Gods promiſes, but the property of that is to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and driue away all doubting; as much as may be.

For if you ſhall turne ouer all <hi>Luthers</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which you haue not ſaluted, nor I beleeue, ſo much as ſeene, yet you can finde this ſentence no where. The Fathers of Trent haue condemned this propoſition and worthily: for it is impious, and to bee reckoned among the chiefeſt paradoxes. But whoſe ſoeuer it was, certainly it was not <hi>Luthers.</hi> But, ſay you, <hi>Luther</hi> wrote ſo in his booke of the captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Babylon. That is falſe: yet he wrote ſome ſuch thing. I will tell you what it is; and that in a word. <hi>Luther</hi> reproueth the Papiſts, for that they thought that the grace of Baptiſme is quite loſt by ſinne, and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:20548:137"/>withall they brought in Penance a new Sacrament, which they terme a ſecond boord, wherby the grace of Baptiſme might be recouered. Therefore he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the power and grace of Baptiſme can ſo bee loſt by ſinnes, but that it may bee repaired by faith; which thing he proueth by many and mighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. In that therefore <hi>Luther</hi> taught, that the grace of Baptiſme cannot be loſt, vnleſſe one will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue; and this the Fathers of Trent and our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triman <hi>Campian</hi> do ſo interprete, as if hee had ſaid, that which theſe men obiect, that a Chriſtian though he will cannot leeſe his ſaluation, vnleſſe he will not beleeue.

For example, he that is a Romane and liueth at Rome muſt obey the Romane lavves? If hee goe into Perſia, he is not bound to keepe there the Romane lavvea vpon any neceſsitie.

We are now at length come to the bottome of this puddle, which although you haue ſtirred with all your diligence, yet you haue not found ſo much as one paradoxe, or a peece of a paradoxe of ours. But now if I would but a little make ſearch into the moſt filthy puddles of your writers, as to recken vp what they haue affirmed, of God, of the Prouidence of God, of Predeſtination, of the Perſon and Offices of Chriſt, of Originall ſin, of the Law, of Righteouſnes, of the Sacraments, of Purgatory, of the Pope of Rome, and of the reſt of the greateſt controuerſies in Religion, how many Carts ſhould I fill with para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, horrible to be ſpoken, or thought? But it is
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:20548:148"/>better not at this time to ſtirre this common Sewre: and otherwhere (I hope) occaſion will be giuen to ſpeake hereof. Now in that you would ioine the Lutherans and Zwinglians together, therein ſurely you haue not offended vs, for we both reuerence <hi>Luther</hi> as a father, and we embrace them as very deere brethren in Chriſt. And verily we hope it will come to paſſe, that this controuerſie, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs being compounded, we ſhall all with ioint minds and ſtudies ſet vpon the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. As for that you ſay touching your ſelfe, I am eaſily perſwaded to thinke it to be true, whether it be that you ſpeake it hartily or ſainedly. For what (I beſeech you) haue you alledged, for which wee ſhould not rather thinke you to be ſome Rhetoricall Actor vpon a Stage, then a learned and experienced Diuine? <hi>Campian,</hi> if you be wiſe, be quiet, for (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me) you cannot indure the force and violence of this combate. Let thoſe choiſe and old ſouldiers put themſelues into the camp, who are, if not more bold to prouoke, yet more wary to auoid blowes, and much more skilfull in all diſcipline of warre. To enter combate with theſe, both the Vniuerſities haue many worthie men, and I truſt there will neuer want excellent Diuines to wage perpetuall warre with the broken bands of Antichriſt.</p>

For whereas before he had prepared it with great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, and brought it into England from Rome, he would ſeeme to vs to haue penned it on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, at idle times in his trauaile, which plainely ſhewes the badnes of his cauſe, and argues more then ordinarie arrogancie.

After Biſhop <hi>Iewell</hi> that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous preacher of the truth, had challenged all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and called them to the triall of antiquitie, ſome yeares ago, certaine bookes were publiſhed by men of great name, <hi>Harding, Rastall, Dorman:</hi> but obſerue their notable policie. When they had been full three yeares in preparing their anſwere, and at length had finiſhed ſomewhat, fearing they ſhould be but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpected by the learned and circumſpect reader, they diſſembled their intent, alleaging that they were written in haſt, not with purpoſe of publiſhing them, but only to ſatisfie the particular requeſt of ſome priuate friends, what could they haue fained more fooliſhly, or affirmed more featefullie?

And yet the matter of the booke, the manner of his ſtile, and his whole gift (as he calleth it) is ſuch, as I eaſily beleeue it was rather done in great haſt, then by mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.

For I doubt not, but you that are the learned of the Vniuerſities, perceiue by this time that thoſe things written in this booke by <hi>Campian,</hi> are ſuch, as for the matter are moſt vntrue, for the ſtile, ſpitefull and malitious.
